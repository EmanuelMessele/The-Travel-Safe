# The Travel Safe
 Project on Travel Compartment Lock

In Engineering 1182, Team Q came together to find a problem, brainstorm solutions, and create a refined prototype to solve the problem. Through the search for a problem, the group came together to list their own specific ideas, and finally a problem and user group was finalized. The group decided to focus on a user group that travels. The problem the group came across was the security of important items whilst traveling such as passports, credit cards, and other items that users would want to take along with them while traveling. The team decided to focus on a goal of making a product that would allow users to keep their items in a safe, portable spot, that if was lost, it could immediately be tracked again, while still having a strong locking ability to keep unwarranted people out.  With this goal, the team created multiple prototypes using CAD and utilized an Arduino and MATLAB to code a 4-digit key locking mechanism. The group wanted to make it so that this product would be able to withstand a force of 5 pounds, a drop, and a water spill, still be small enough for portability, but big enough to still fit items. After creating the first prototype, verification testing was completed. Attached is the MATLAB code created for the 4- button lock system.
